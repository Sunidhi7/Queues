Statistical Simulation of Queues

Queues can be modeled mathematically in several ways. This project aims at looking at some of the important queues from two such ways: from congestion point of view and workload point of view. The basic approach behind the simulation is discussed and some of the important parameters like expected number of customers in the queue, expected delay etc. are analysed. The known theoretical results are validated by comparing them with the simulation results. 

For all the models, we assume unlimited buffer space, infinite population of users and FIFO(First In First Out) service discipline, unless specified. Also, we assume that the system is work conserving.
